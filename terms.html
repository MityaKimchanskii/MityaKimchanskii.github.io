            </h2> 
            <p>These Terms of Use (”Terms”) govern your use of CookBookHub and provide information about the CookBookHub Services, outlined below. When you create a CookBookHub account or use CookBookHub, you agree to these terms.
                These Terms of Use apply to all users of CookBookHub mobile-device applications we offer, such our iOS application, that are branded "CookBookHub" and link or reference this Terms of Use (collectively, the "Service").
                For the purpose of these Terms, a User is an individual who uses our Service.‍
            </p>

            <h2>Our Service</h2>
            <p>Subject to these Terms, we agree to provide you with the CookBookHub Service. The Service includes all of the CookBookHub products, features, applications, technologies and software that we provide to advance CookBookHub mission: To help you eat intelligently.
                CookBookHub helps you discover recipes you can cook. To do that, we show you things we think will be relevant, interesting and personal to you based on your onsite and offsite activity. To provide our Service, we need to be able to identify you and your interests. The Service is made up of the following aspects:
                ‍People are different, and so are the things we eat. We want to strengthen your relationship with food through personalized experiences you actually care about. So we build systems that try to understand who and what you and others care about, and use that information to help you create, find, cook, and share experiences that matter to you. Part of that is highlighting content, features, offers, and accounts you might be interested in, and offering ways for you to experience CookBookHub, based on things you and others do on and off CookBookHub.
                
                ‍We develop and use tools and offer resources to our users that help make their experiences positive and inclusive, including when we think they might need help. We have systems that work to combat abuse and violations of our Terms and policies, as well as harmful and deceptive behavior. We use all the information we have-including your information-to try to keep our platform secure. We also may share information about misuse or harmful content with law enforcement. Learn more in the Privacy Policy.
                
                ‍Organizing and analyzing information for our growing community is central to our Service. A big part of our Service is creating and using cutting-edge technologies that help us personalize, protect, and improve our Service on an incredibly large scale for a broad community. Technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning give us the power to apply complex processes across our Service. Automated technologies also help us ensure the functionality and integrity of our Service.
                
                ‍We may use data from CookBookHub, as well as from third-party partners, to show you ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we believe will be meaningful to you. And we try to make that content as relevant as all your other experiences on CookBookHub.
                ‍We use the information we have to study our Service and collaborate with others on research to make our Service better and contribute to the well-being of our community.
            </p>

For example, we may show that you liked a sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads on CookBookHub. As with actions on other content and follows of other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your settings.
                ‍
                How long we keep your content.
                Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User Content from CookBookHub, we may keep your User Content for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.

            </h2>

            <p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.
                Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver.
                We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
                This agreement does not give rights to any third parties.
                You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.
                Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.
                Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren’t responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our Service.
                Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms will not exceed the greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.
                You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of any claim. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you, and you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.
                ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. WE EXPLAIN SOME EXCEPTIONS AND HOW YOU CAN OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION BELOW.
                Except as provided below, you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you and us arising out of or related to these Terms or CookBookHub ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual basis. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; you and we may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other CookBookHub users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim (or a request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only that claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain subject to this provision.
                Instead of using arbitration, you or we can bring claims in your local "small claims" court, if the rules of that court will allow it. If you don't bring your claims in small claims court (or if you or we appeal a small claims court judgment to a court of general jurisdiction), then the claims must be resolved by binding, individual arbitration. The American Arbitration Association will administer all arbitrations under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.
                The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes related to intellectual property (like copyrights and trademarks), or efforts to interfere with the Service or engage with the Service in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide. This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these Terms. To opt out, you must send your name, residence address, username, or email address you use for your CookBookHub account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them at dkimiosdev@gmail.com.
                For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Francisco County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim. The laws of the State of California, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
            </p>

                You hereby represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government “watch list” of prohibited or restricted parties, including the Specially Designated Nationals list published by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury or the Denied Persons List published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

            <h2>Changes and Updates to These Terms
            </h2>
