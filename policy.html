            <p>This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") explains how Smart Penny LLC ("CookBookHub", "us", "our" and "we") collects, uses, and shares information when you interact with us, and covers our processing activities as a data controller. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, a User is an individual who uses our Service.
                Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy replaces and supersedes the last version of this Privacy Policy for all users (including for those users that registered prior to the Effective Date). If you do not agree to our practices, please do not register, subscribe, create an account, or otherwise interact with the Service. By signing up for, using, or continuing to use the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this policy.
                This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the CookBookHub Terms of Use. Capitalized terms that are not defined in the Privacy Policy may have the meaning given to them in the <a href="./terms.html" title="Contact"> Terms of Use</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>How we collect information</h2>

            <p>We may ask you to provide information when you register, subscribe, or create an account for our Service or otherwise interact with or use the Service. We may collect certain types of information, including information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address and other types of personal information (“Personal Information”), and information that does not identify you personally. We may collect the following types of information:
                When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it:
                Registration and Contact Information when you register for the Service. This information allows us to communicate with you, such as your name, email address. 
                Purchase Information about the items you purchase, such as item descriptions and quantities, time of purchase, total purchase cost, and the store you purchased the items from.‍
                We also get technical information when you use CookBookHub
                Search Information, meaning the terms or keywords you search for when using the Service on the CookBookHub mobile application.
                Mobile Device Information. We collect certain information about your mobile device when you use our Service, including device identifier (such as the Apple iOS IDFA), user settings, the make, model, and operating system of your device. 
                Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies. When you use our Service, we and our partners may collect certain information using cookies and similar technologies, such as pixel tags, web beacons, browser analysis tools, and web server logs. Cookies are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser/app. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser/app and may be used by your browser/app on subsequent visits to the Service. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed specific actions. When you access these pages or open email messages, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action to us, or our service providers. These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.
                
                We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies. For example, we may collect and record information from the devices you use to access our Service, such as your IP address, operating system type or mobile device model, mobile device identifiers, browser type, domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone of your device. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to our Service.
                
                In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is used in non-identifiable ways, without any reference to Personal Information. For example, we use information we collect about users to optimize our Service and understand its traffic and usage patterns. In other cases, we associate the information we collect using cookies and related technologies with Personal Information. In that case, this Privacy Policy governs how we use that information. Additionally, if you have visited our mobile website or activated one of our mobile-device applications, and if the settings on your location-aware device allow us to receive Location Information, we will collect that automatically. If we associate Location Information with other Personal Information, this Privacy Policy governs how we would use that information too.
                
                Please review your web browser’s “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, please be aware that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from our Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of our Service to their fullest potential. Finally, please scroll down to the Your Choices section below, under the heading “cookies,” for more information about your cookie-related privacy options.

By participating, you may provide us with certain information about the person to whom you refer our service, such as name and email address.

                Information from Third Parties. We may receive information about you from third parties and combine it with information we have about you.
                
                If you use a social media platform, a mobile device or other third-party method of communication to interact with CookBookHub or the Service, that platform may have a specific privacy statement that governs the use of information related to that platform. If you have questions about the security and privacy settings of your mobile device, please refer to instructions from your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.
